# kagerou

ACT-OverlayPlugin skin for FF14. pronounced as /ka-ge-row/ (not j-like g).

Modern, Material Design, easily configurable, cloud-hosted and always up-to-date.

Currently, kagerou overlay isn't being actively developed.
It doesn't mean kagerou is not nor no longer work, all feature should be working and every critical bug will be fixed.

I also suggest my other overlay project, [ikegami](https://github.com/hibiyasleep/ikegami), which featuers horizontal layout.
